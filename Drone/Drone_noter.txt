Notes:

PWM:
- When we want to change the frequency for the pwm signals, look at the following page: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_pulse.html
- Pay attention 


MCU:
- Current consumption ok - but is it a problem that it receives a "constant" current supply of 500mA
- Clock is not constant (maybe a cooling plade)
- Should we use FSYNC?? As I understand, it makes it possible to gather data at the end of clock cycles
instead of the MCU keeps asking for data and only gets a bit at a time
- Add LED 
- Add measure wires


Communication:
- SBUS on UART pin
- Pay attention to the invertion of SBUS signal comparet to the UART 

Debug pins:
- Remember these!

Blinking Led:
- To see that MCU is alive:))

Software:
- Interrupts

MPU6881:

- In document above it says what to do about the exposed pad (don't solder)

SPI design:
- https://www.pjrc.com/better-spi-bus-design-in-3-steps/
- Nødvendigt med Tri state buffer (ingen mulighed for test)???
- Magnetometer og IMU kan køre på samme SPI linje - 1 MHZ

Buzzer design: 
- Is there something we must be careful about?

Magnetometer: 
- Find another one 

GPS:
- Keep antenna away from circuitry
- Omslut RF banen med ground

RC modtager:
- Stik til RC modtager
- Uart på MCU
